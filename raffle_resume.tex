  % \section{Summary}
  % I am a data scientist and statistician with a strong background in
  % both software development and statistical analysis.  My experience in
  % teaching and research has allowed me the opportunity to not only learn
  % and implement a variety of statistical and machine learning models,
  % but also hone my presentation skills and work closely with experts in a
  % variety of fields.  My goal is to find a challenging
  % position where I can solve novel problems and make data-driven
  % policy recommendations.

    Data Science work efforts to ensure they met the standards of HIG
   Data Science Standard Work.
  \item Consulted with Actuarial leadership on the adoption of emerging
    technologies/platforms and incorporating statistical modeling,
    machine learning, and modern data technologies into their business
    processes.

    (e.g., stochastic reserve modeling, modeled indications, claim-level
    loss development) and worked with Actuarial partners to integrate
    these insights into their workflows.
  \item Designed curriculum for and conducted classroom-based training in an
    intensive 8-week program for actuaries. The course teaches modern data
    science techniques and data technologies and includes a hands-on
    capstone project.
