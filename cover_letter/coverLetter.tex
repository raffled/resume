{\bf RE: Temporary Pool Faculty}\\

Dear Search Committee,

\sectionspace

As an Undergraduate Student Assistant at CalU while pursuing my BS in
Computer Science, I found a passion for teaching Mathematics,
Statistics, and Computer Science. Throughout graduate school at WVU, I
was able to hone my teaching skills and get experience teaching larger
laboratory sections, and eventually teaching my own lecture
section of introductory statistics in my final year. Even while
pursuing my own studies and working on research projects, one of the
parts I most enjoyed was presenting results and explaining the
concepts to others.\\ 
\sectionspace
I decided not to pursue a Ph.D. after earning my Master's, but I have
found myself missing the classroom more and more.  When I heard that CalU was
looking for someone to teach a class in Business Statistics, my
interest was immediately piqued.  At Mylan, I perform business
analytics and market intelligence research; using 
statistics and machine learning to gain insight into our markets and
answer business questions.  Essentially, I am a business statistician.\\
\sectionspace
Having experience both in teaching at a college level and in
using statistics in a business setting, I feel that I would be a great
fit for this course (and similar courses), and I very much hope to
hear from you.
