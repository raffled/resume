\section{Overview}
\begin{flushleft}
This is a collection of projects I've worked on that I think are
particularly cool. Whether created for class projects, formal
research, or just for fun (and practice), I hope you find them as
interesting as I did. Feel free to browse the projects on my
\urlstyle{same}\href{http://www.github.com/raffled/}{Github} page, or take the guided tour
of selected projects below. Direct links to the formatted documents
(Shiny apps, knitted HTML, or PDF) are provided, as well as to the
specific repositories containing the source code.\\

For a more interactive version that's being constantly updated, you
can also check out 
\urlstyle{same}\href{http://stat.wvu.edu/~draffle/portfolio}{the portfolio section of my website}
